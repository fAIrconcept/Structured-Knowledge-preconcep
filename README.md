# 🧠💥🐵 twosky's structures knowledge
Knowledge is a complex task/problem.
My approach is to structure it, so computers/tools can store, historice, analyze, compare it.(tree, mindmap to show main points and what advanced techniques are.)

As this is a pillar of modern times, it is essential that this is structure is shared, *improvable*, accessible, *solid*.

# 🧠💥🐵 twosky's structures knowledge
Knowledge is a complex task/problem.
My approach is to structure it, so computers/tools can store, historice, analyze, compare it.(tree, mindmap to show main points and what advanced techniques are.)

As this is a pillar of modern times, it is essential that this is structure is shared, *improvable*, accessible, *solid*.

Layered Embedding Strategy
Instead of treating embeddings as flat, we treat them as hierarchical representations:

Knowledge Layer	Embedding Strategy
1. Raw Data (Facts, Measurements)	✅ Direct sentence embeddings using paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2.
2. Pattern Recognition (Correlations, Rules)	🔹 Use clustering over multiple embeddings to find recurring patterns.
3. Conceptual Models (Theories, Frameworks)	🔹 Train a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to represent semantic connections between embeddings.
4. Actionable Knowledge (Processes, Applications)	🔹 Encode relationships using knowledge graph embeddings (TransE, RotatE, ComplEx).
5. Meta-Knowledge (Knowledge about Knowledge)	🔹 Represent using contrastive learning (e.g., SimCSE) to detect differences in reasoning approaches.
